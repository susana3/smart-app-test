<h2>Users List App</h2>

**_Description_**

This project is a responsive user directory app that displays a list of users with their names, usernames, emails, and phone numbers. The app is built using React, Redux for state management, and TypeScript for type safety.

**_Approach_**

This app includes a combination of React components, Redux for managing global state, and TypeScript for ensuring type safety and code maintainability. I focused on creating a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience.

**_Redux Integration_**

Redux is integrated to manage the app's state, allowing for efficient data sharing between components, enabling to:

- Store user data in a centralized store
- Use actions and reducers to update the state
- Connect components to the store for real-time updates

**_TypeScript Implementation_**

The use of TypeScript ensures type safety and code maintainability, achieving:

- Define clear types for props, state, and actions
- Catch errors early through type checking
- Improve code readability and maintainability

**_Deployment_**

The app is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it easy to share and access the live app.
